# Euchre_plusplus

A C++ implementation of the game Euchre. This is not a playable version. The program currently has functionality for managing a deck of cards, dealing hands to multiple players, and evaluating the value of a given card based on the trump suit of that round. 

The program outputs the name of the player, the players hand, and an evaluation of how strong that hand is based on the trump suit.
